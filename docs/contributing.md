# openGCAS - Contributing Guide

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Developing with [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
All code changes happen through pull requests which are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. 
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue your pull request!

## Contributions and Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Software License that covers this repository. 
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/FAA-VAIL-Project/sds/issues){:target="_blank"}

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FAA-VAIL-Project/sds/issues/new){:target="_blank"}; it's that easy!

## Write thorough bug reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Software Development Standards

Any change must comply with our [Software Development Standards](https://faa-vail-project.github.io/sds/){:target="_blank"}
