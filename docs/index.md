## 1. Introduction
openGCAS is the first open-source autonomous safety system for aviation.  It contains the algorithms necessary to provide automatic ground collision avoidance for small general aviation airplanes.  The goal of the project is to work to save the many small airplane pilots and passengers who die of ground collision every year (100 in the US on average), and to work towards opening up safe and effective aviation for all.

## 2. Features
- Trajectory prediction models for many types of airplanes starting with a Cessna 182
- Allows incorporation of many different raster and compressed terrain data models
- Software in the loop testing using [JSB Sim](https://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/) for the airplane dynamics engine.
- Unit testing of the trajectory prediction and terrain data management functions
